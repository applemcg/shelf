#+TITLE: Trace Family User Guide

* COMMENT TODO

* Scope

This is User Guide for the Trace function Family  supporting the [[./shelf.org][SHELF Standard]].  

The Trace Family functions allow the user to trace function calls, writing
pertinent information to the standard error.   The typical use is to put this line
: trace_call $*
at an early point in a function.

The SHELF Standard calls for a trace feature.

* Trace Family Functions

** trace_call
** trace_on, off
** trace_stderr

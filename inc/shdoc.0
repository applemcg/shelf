# shdoc, shd_with

# The functions here operate on  shell functions, and operate similar to
# the  three mentioned  above: Java,  Perl,  and Python.   The two  most
# useful functions, *shdoc* and *shd_with* produce a function whose body
# is  the collected  comments in  what  I'm calling  *shdoc*, or  /shell
# doclib comment/ format:
# [[file:~/Dropbox/commonplace/software/shreadme.org::*shdoc,%20shd_with][shdoc\,\ shd_with:1]]
@include shdoc.1
@include shdoc.2
@include shdoc.3
shdoc_init ()
{
   fam_iam
}
# shdoc\,\ shd_with:1 ends here
